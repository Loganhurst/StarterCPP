# How to turn in an inlab:

1.	Accept the invitation from github classroom at the top of inlab document.  
2.	Do the work
3.  For all  steps:  Anytime you see a spot where it says:  have your instructor or a classmate check Part X NOW
    *	Create an issue on your repository that is labeled: INLAB x PART y.  
    *	If you are in class, show it to a neighbor or the instructor and have them sign off in the body of your issue.  They can say something like:  *I saw this and it worked.  Bob.*
   *	If you are outside of class:
      * Create a screen shot of the output to your issue and then:
      *  Commit your code.  You can do this via the web interface by editing and replacing the code.  Your commit comment must be:  INLAB x PART y.  
    *	For the final step, commit your code even if you are in class.
    
_Always commit your code when you stop working on it._  This should have a commit comment of at least “saving work”.    I’ll expect to see that you have commits when you leave the class room or when there are big jumps in time on your steps.
